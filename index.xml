As a result I removed the OAI and made the bucket public. This simplifies it somewhat, and the content is all publically available regardless.

ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) Create an Amazon ACM certificate and validate with the appropriate DNS records that are output. As CloudFront requires the certificate to be in us-east-1, we need to ensure the certificate is created in that region.

I thought this would be a good opportunity to dip my toes into serverless, which through various articles led me to Hugo. It also gives me a good excuse to practice my writing in Markdown.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be using Terraform for most of the AWS configuration, avoiding the console as much as possible.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://halme.org/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://halme.org/about/</guid><description>Hugo is the worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites.
